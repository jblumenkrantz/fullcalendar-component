      <b>NOTES</b> - This page is a good candidate for the grid because the original has two columns of content without any fancy page layout tricks. The only problem is that it looks kind of cramped and the columns are affected by wordwrap limitations and actually aren't necessary anymore. Scroll to the bottom to see a single column version. <br>(Source: <a href="https://schooldatebooks.com/resources/reference_pages/large-college-reference-pages/language-arts/BigCollegeReferenceLanguageArts_parts-of-speech.pdf" target="_blank">Original PDF</a>)

    <div class="panel dark"><b>NOUN: </b> a word that names a person, place, thing, quality, act or feeling.</div>
    <p><b>Common nouns</b> are general and do not refer to a specific person, location or object. 
    <i>Examples:</i> man, city, tonight, honesty, happiness</p>
    <p><b>Proper nouns</b> are capitalized and refer to a particular person, place or thing. 
    <i>Examples:</i> Reggie, Market Square Arena, Saturday </p>

    <div class="panel dark"><b>PRONOUN: </b>A WORD THAT TAKES THE PLACE OF A NOUN.</div>
    <p><b>Nominative Case Pronouns</b> replace the subject of a sentence or clause. 
    <br>
    <i>Examples:</i> She took the bus to visit Aunt Jane. We are looking forward to visiting Oregon. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Objective Case Pronouns</b> receive a verb’s action or follow a preposition.
    <br>
    <i>Examples:</i> Please give me the papers. Timothy’s outstanding service earned him the award. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Possessive Case Pronouns</b> show ownership or possession.

    </p>

    <div class="panel dark"><b>VERB:</b> A WORD THAT EXPRESSES ACTION OR A STATE OF BEING. IT ALSO INDICATES THE TIME OF ACTION OR STATE OF BEING. A VERB HAS DIFFERENT FORMS DEPENDING ON ITS NUMBER, PERSON, VOICE, TENSE AND MOOD.</div>
    <p><b>Number</b> indicates whether a verb is singular or plural. The verb and its subject must agree in number.
    <br>
    <i>Examples:</i> One dog barks. Two dogs bark. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Person</b> indicates whether the subject of the verb is 1st, 2nd or 3rd person and whether the subject is singular or plural. Verbs usually have a di erent form only in third person singular of the <i>present tense</i>.</p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><i><i>Examples:</i></i></td>
          <td><i>Singular</i></td>

    <br>
    <i>Examples:</i> Cathy wrote the letter. <i>(active voice)</i><br>
    The letter was written by Cathy. <i>(passive voice)</i>
    </p>

    <div class="panel dark"><b>ADVERB: </b> A WORD THAT DESCRIBES OR MODIFIES A VERB, AN ADJECTIVE OR ANOTHER ADVERB. AN ADVERB TELLS HOW, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW OFTEN AND HOW MUCH.</div>
    <p>Example: The ball rolled <i>slowly</i> around the rim. 
    <br>
    Soccer scores are reported <i>daily</i> in the newspaper.

  <div class="six columns">
    <div class="panel dark"><b>ADJECTIVE: </b> A WORD THAT DESCRIBES OR MODIFIES NOUNS AND PRONOUNS. ADJECTIVES SPECIFY COLOR, SIZE, NUMBER AND THE LIKE.</div>
    <p><i>Examples:</i> red, large, three, gigantic, miniature Adjectives have three forms: <b>positive</b>, <b>comparative</b>, and <b>superlative</b>.</p>
    <p>The <b>positive</b> form describes a noun or pronoun without comparing it to anything else.
    <br>
    Example: My apple pie is good. 
    </p>
    <p>The comparative form compares two things.
    <br>
    Example: Aunt Betty’s apple pie is better than mine.
    </p>
    <p>The superlative form compares three or more things.
    <br>
    Example: Mom’s apple pie is the best of all!

    <div class="panel dark"><b>CONJUNCTION: </b> A WORD THAT CONNECTS INDIVIDUAL WORDS OR GROUPS OF WORDS.</div>
    <p><b>Coordinating conjunctions</b> connect a word to a word, a clause to a clause, or a phrase to a phrase. The sentence elements joined by a coordinating conjunction must be equal. Common coordinating conjunctions are: and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so. Coordinating conjunctions used in pairs are called correlative conjunctions. Common correlative conjunctions are: <i>either, or; neither, nor; not only, but also; both, and; whether, or</i>. 
    <i>Examples:</i> Raccoons and squirrels frequently invade our birdfeeders. 
    <br>
    Neither Mary Ann nor Julie will be able to go with you. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> connect and show the relationship between two clauses that are not equally important. Common subordinate conjunctions are: until, unless, since, where, before, as, if, when, although, after, because, while, as long as, as if, though, whereas. 
    <br>
    <i>Examples:</i> Until you decide to study, your grades won’t improve. <br>
    If I hadn’t already made plans, I would have enjoyed going to the mall with you.
    </p>
    
    <div class="panel dark"><b>INTERJECTION: </b> A WORD THAT IS USED IN A SENTENCE TO COMMUNICATE STRONG EMOTION OR SURPRISE. PUNCTUATION IS USED TO SEPARATE AN INTERJECTION FROM THE REST OF THE SENTENCE.</div>
    <p><i>Examples:</i> Hooray! We finally scored a touchdown. <br>
    Oh, no! I forgot the picnic basket. <br>
    Yes! Her gymnastic routine was perfect. <br>
