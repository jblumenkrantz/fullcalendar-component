        <span class="serif">
        {1} The application process begins in NINTH grade. Your grades and coursework will directly impact your admittance to college.<br>
        {2} Fill your schedule with a variety of subjects and difficulty. Colleges are looking for well-rounded students who are highly motivated. Do your best in each class. Do not let a class slip because it does not interest you. Colleges look for a consistent performance in all subjects.<br>
        {3} Take the SAT or ACT in time to include your scores on college applications.<br>
        {4} Look at as many potential colleges as possible. Do not limit your options. <br>
        {5} Visit as many campuses as possible and talk to students, staff and the office of admissions while at the college.<br>
        {6} Send applications to prospective colleges beginning in early fall of your senior year. You can obtain applications and information in the guidance office or online at university and college websites.<br>
        {7} Fill out any potential scholarship forms and send them to the appropriate personnel.<br>
        {8} Allow at least two weeks for your counselor to process your applications.<br>

        <span class="sans"><b>Steps for Juniors</b></span><br>
        {1} Talk to your counselor about filling your junior-year class schedule with coursework in English, foreign language, social studies, science, and mathematics. It is recommended that students take as many mathematics courses as possible.<br>
        {2} Colleges are looking for well-rounded students in the arts, business, drama, and speech.<br>
        {3} Find out when potential universities are visiting your school or when your school is going on visitations to potential colleges.<br>
        {4} It is best to visit campuses when classes are in session, not spring break, Christmas, etc.<br>
        {5} Take a course that prepares you for the SAT or ACT.<br>
        {6} At the beginning of your junior year, take the PSAT exam to practice and gauge yourself for the SAT.<br>
        {7} Take the SAT or ACT in the spring of your junior year. If you feel the score does not reflect your ability, retake the exam during your senior year.<br>
        {8} Start applying for any scholarships for which you feel you are qualified.<br>
        {9} If you know your intended field of study in college, schedule your senior year with an emphasis in that area.<br>
        {10} Plan to visit as many colleges during the summer as possible.<br>
        <span class="sans"><b>Steps for Seniors</b></span><br>
        {1} Attend as many college fairs as possible in your local area.<br>
        {2} Visit as many institutions and universities as possible. It is best to visit campuses when classes are in session. <br>
        (Not spring break, Christmas or any major holiday.)<br>
        {3} When visiting colleges, meet with the admissions office and financial aid office as well as speak with professors <br>
        in your intended field of study.<br>
        {4} Talk to older friends and students about that particular college or university.<br>
        {5} Ensure that your SAT or ACT scores meet the requirements of the colleges and universities that interest you. If necessary, retake the entrance exams.<br>
        {6} Make a list of admission deadlines at the colleges you are interested in attending.<br>
        {7} Submit completed college applications to your guidance counselor, and be sure to include any application fees.<br>
        {8} File a financial aid form.<br>
        {9} Inquire about any available scholarships, and be sure to meet the appropriate requirements and deadlines.<br>
