			<b>NOTES</b> - This page is not a good candidate for porting to the grid. First of all, there are too many overlapping elements. It will be difficult to exactly reproduce this layout in foundation using mostly html because of wordwrap and resizing. There are also too many fonts being used (six!) and there is some watermarking too. We can make something with similar content but it will not look exactly like the print version.<br>(Source: <a href="https://schooldatebooks.com/resources/reference_pages/large-college-reference-pages/character/BigCollegeReferenceCharacter_people-of-character.pdf" target="_blank">Original PDF</a>)
